Credits: Used some idea from https://github.com/ideamonk/spojbackup for Spoj  

TODO::  
1) For fetching code of Codeforces gym submissions, password is also required. So currently, no gym submissions will be downloaded.   
2) Add check to verify if the handle is valid.  






**Update 3 :** <br> 
Proxy Support is added. Now its has become easy for competitive programmers(mostly college students) to download codes behind their college proxies without setting it manually.

*Features Added:* <br>
1) You can download codes by specifying proxy via a proxy server also
